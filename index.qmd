## About EuroCIM

The general theme of the meeting is “Causal Inference in Health, Economic and Social Sciences”. Causal inference is broadly defined, and the focus is on statistical methodology and challenging applications that highlight necessary methodological extensions.

- EuroCIM aims to provide a forum for people interested in causal inference to meet informally,
for early career and established researchers to present and discuss the latest developments in the field,
and to offer opportunities for networking to develop future research opportunities and collaborations.
- EuroCIM evolved from what used to be the “UK Causal Inference Meetings” (UK-CIM). 

Please note that registration for the meeting is not restricted to people from Europe, and we welcome participation from anyone who would like to attend!
